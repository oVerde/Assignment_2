          Casa Lubra was a project developed in 2024 with the goal of renewing
          the company's visual identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a local store dedicated to selling home comfort products, such
          as bed linens, towels, and similar items.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the intention of conveying comfort and quality, I proposed a new
          identity that involved a complete redesign of the logo and color
          palette. The only retained feature from the previous identity was the
          logo font, inspired by Bauhaus typography, to preserve a sense of
          heritage associated with the brand. This choice also ensured the
          change was not too aggressive, considering the public's familiarity
          with the existing identity.
