          This project was based on a proposal from the Project 3 course during
          my Bachelor in Design and Multimedia at the University of Coimbra.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proposal had two main goals: the first was to transform one of the
          short stories provided by the university into an editorial object. As
          it was a group project, my team and I chose the short story by Roald
          Dahl *“The Great Automatic Grammatizator”*, a satire on the automation
          of creative writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering this context, we developed the idea of creating a card
          game in which the entire environment would reference the story.

              Regarding the cards, 60 units were created, divided into two main
              groups. The first 30 cards are dedicated to creativity and
              humanization. They feature a more organic serif typography with
              blue background lines representing humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second half of the deck represents the machine and automation,
              increasingly evident in the second part of the text. These cards
              use modern sans-serif typography and red color, symbolizing the
              machine and the potential threat to human authorship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the short story text had to be fully available, it was
              divided across all cards, each excerpt associated with a specific
              theme. These themes differentiate each card, with images
              referencing the story in a satirical way.
